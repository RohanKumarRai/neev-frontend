      <h2>About Monopsy</h2>

      <p>
        Monopsy was born from a simple observation: finding reliable
        workers for short-term and task-based jobs is still surprisingly
        difficult, and for skilled workers, finding consistent work is
        even harder.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started Monopsy after closely seeing how electricians, plumbers,
        helpers, delivery workers, and other skilled individuals struggle
        to get timely and fair work — despite having real skills. On the
        other side, employers often rely on word-of-mouth, uncertainty,
        and last-minute fixes to get work done.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem wasn’t a lack of talent or demand — it was the absence
        of a trusted, simple, and dignified platform connecting the two.
        That gap is what Monopsy aims to fill.
      </p>

      <h3>How We Built Monopsy</h3>

      <p>
        From day one, the focus was clear: execution over perfection.
        Instead of waiting for funding, large teams, or ideal conditions,
        Monopsy was built as a working product first.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform was designed, developed, tested, and deployed step by
        step — solving one real problem at a time. Every feature exists
        because it solves an actual need: posting jobs, applying easily,
        managing applications, assigning work, and completing jobs —
        without unnecessary complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Monopsy is not built in theory. It is built through continuous
        learning, fast iteration, and real-world use.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>

      <p>
        Monopsy’s vision is to become India’s most trusted platform for
        blue-collar and skilled work — where workers are respected,
        employers find reliability, and opportunities are distributed
        fairly.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that access to work is access to dignity. In the long
        run, Monopsy aims to help workers build digital profiles, gain
        visibility, access financial services, and create long-term
        stability — not just daily income.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is just the beginning. Monopsy is being built with patience,
        honesty, and a deep commitment to solving real problems — one job,
        one worker, and one employer at a time.
